#Setup

##Cliche	

Clone this repository:

- <https://github.com/budhash/cliche.git>

Create a new Eclipse java project called 'cliche' and incorporate the source into this project. The simplest way of doing this is to create a new eclipse project and drag/drop the `src/main/java/com` folder directly into the `src` folder of the blank eclipse project.

##Pacemakerconsole

Using the pacemaker-console project from  lab-01, or this repo here:

- <https://github.com/wit-design-patterns-2016/pacemaker-console/releases/tag/Lab01>

Import into eclipse.

This project contains an jar file for cliche. Remove this from the project. This will generate errors.

Fix these errors by making the pacemaker-console project depend on the cliche project (Project Properties->Java Build Path->Projects)

You will need to change the imports in PacemakerShell, as the packages have been renamed in the github repo:

~~~
import com.budhash.cliche.Command;
import com.budhash.cliche.Param;
import com.budhash.cliche.Shell;
import com.budhash.cliche.ShellFactory;
~~~

Verify that pacemaker-console works as expected.


##Refactor pacemaker-console:

Make the following small change to pacemaker-console:

- Create a new package called 'main'
- Move the class PacemakerShell from 'controllers' into this package.

This will trigger a range of visibility errors, as PacemakerShell is now in a different package. All of the errors can be removed by making all methods in PacemakerShell public.
