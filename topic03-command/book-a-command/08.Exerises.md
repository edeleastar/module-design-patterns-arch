##Solution so far:

- <https://github.com/wit-design-patterns-2016/pacemaker-console/releases/tag/Lab03a>

##More commands

Introduce some more commands from the reference implementation. This will involve:

- Defining a Command derived class
- Extending the 'CommandDescriptor' class to specific the command to cliche
- Creating and inserting the command into the command map in the PacemakerShell constructor

##undo/redo

Try the following:

~~~
Welcome to pacemaker-console - ?help for instructions
pm> cu a a a a
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+
| ID | FIRSTNAME | LASTNAME | EMAIL | PASSWORD |
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+
|  1 |         a |        a |     a |        a |
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+

pm> cu b b b b
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+
| ID | FIRSTNAME | LASTNAME | EMAIL | PASSWORD |
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+
|  2 |         b |        b |     b |        b |
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+

pm> undo
pm> undo

Why are we getting the above error?

If you resolve this error, you will note it has a serious design flaw, requiring some significant rethink in order to make this work as expected.
