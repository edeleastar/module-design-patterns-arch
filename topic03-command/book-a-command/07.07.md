#Updated Dispatcher

We also need to make these commands known to cliche by putting them in the CommandDescriptor class:

~~~
  @Command(description="undo last command")
  public void undo () throws Exception
  {}
  
  @Command(description="redo last command")
  public void redo () throws Exception
  {}
~~~

The dispatchCommand method will need to be reworked as follows:

~~~java
  public boolean dispatchCommand(String commandName, Object [] parameters) throws Exception
  {
    boolean dispatched = false;
    Command command = commands.get(commandName);

    if (command != null)
    { 
      dispatched = true;
      command.doCommand(parameters);
      if ((command instanceof CreateUserCommand) || (command instanceof DeleteUserCommand))
      {
        undoBuffer.push(command);
      }
    }
    return dispatched;
  }
~~~

Note that only CreateUserCommand and DeleteUserCommand are 'undoable'.

We should be in a position to test this now. A session might go something like this:

~~~
Welcome to pacemaker-console - ?help for instructions
pm> cu a a a a
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+
| ID | FIRSTNAME | LASTNAME | EMAIL | PASSWORD |
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+
|  1 |         a |        a |     a |        a |
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+

pm> undo
pm> lu

pm> 
~~~

Redo should also work:

~~~
Welcome to pacemaker-console - ?help for instructions
pm> cu a a a a
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+
| ID | FIRSTNAME | LASTNAME | EMAIL | PASSWORD |
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+
|  1 |         a |        a |     a |        a |
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+

pm> undo
pm> lu

pm> redo
pm> lu
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+
| ID | FIRSTNAME | LASTNAME | EMAIL | PASSWORD |
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+
|  2 |         a |        a |     a |        a |
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+
