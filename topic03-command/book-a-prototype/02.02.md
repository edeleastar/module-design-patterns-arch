#Prototype in Command

Extend the Command abstract class to include a new method:

~~~java
  public Command copy()
  {
    return null;
  }
~~~

We provide a default implementation, as opposed to an abstract one.

We can implement this in the CreateUserCommand:

~~~java
  public Command copy()
  {
    CreateUserCommand command = new CreateUserCommand(pacemaker, parser);
    command.ser = user;
    return command;
  }
~~~

and also in the DeleteUserCommand:

~~~java
  public Command copy()
  {
    DeleteUserCommand command = new DeleteUserCommand(pacemaker, parser);
    command.ser = user;
    return command;
  }
~~~

We can leave ListUsersCommand untouched, as we do not consider it 'undable'.
