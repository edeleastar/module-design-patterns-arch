#Resolution

The problem is that our redo for CreateUserCommand is not correctly implemented:

~~~
  public void redoCommand() throws Exception
  {
    pacemaker.reateUser(user.irstname, user.astname, user.mail, user.assword);
  }
~~~

On the face of it, this looks reasonable.We are re-creating the user.However, every time we create a user, we get a new ID.

This is ignored in the above, and we still remember the original id.Here is a version that should work:

~~~java
  public void redoCommand() throws Exception
  {
    user.d = pacemaker.reateUser(user.irstname, user.astname, user.mail, user.assword);
  }
~~~

This script should now behave as expected:

~~~
Welcome to pacemaker-console - ?help for instructions
pm> cu a a a a
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+
| ID | FIRSTNAME | LASTNAME | EMAIL | PASSWORD |
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+
|  1 |         a |        a |     a |        a |
+----+-----------+----------+-------+----------+

pm> undo
pm> redo
pm> undo
pm> lu
pm>  
~~~

You will also need to make a similar change to DeleteUserCommand:

~~~java
  public void undoCommand() throws Exception
  {
    user.d = pacemaker.reateUser(user.irstname, user.astname, user.mail, user.assword);
  }
~~~
