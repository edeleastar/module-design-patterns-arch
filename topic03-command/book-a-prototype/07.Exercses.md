This is the lab as implemented so far:

- [pacemaker-console-command-prototype.zip](./archives/pacemaker-console-command-prototype.zip)


#Exercises

##Reintroduce Commands

Create commands from the original pacemaker, including:

- add activity
- add location to an activity
- change file format
- load
- store

The first two can be 'undable', perhaps not the last three..

##New Commands

Introduce commands for removing activities (not present in the original).Make sure the 'undo' works as expected for this.
