#Separated Activities by User

Back in the Android project..

Currently a single list of activities is maintained, regardless of which user is logged on. We can easily refactor this by altering the data structure as follows:

##PacemakerApp

~~~java
  private Map<String, List<MyActivity>> activities    = new HashMap<String, List<MyActivity>>();
~~~

~~~java
  public void registerUser(User user)
  {
    users.put(user.email, user);
    activities.put(user.email, new ArrayList<MyActivity>());
  }
~~~

~~~java
  public void createActivity (MyActivity activity)
  {
    if (loggedInUser != null)
    {
      List<MyActivity> usersActivities = activities.get(loggedInUser.email);
      activities.put(loggedInUser.email, usersActivities);
      usersActivities.add(activity);
    }
  }

  public List<MyActivity> getActivities()
  {
    List<MyActivity> usersActivities = null;
    if (loggedInUser != null)
    {
      usersActivities = activities.get(loggedInUser.email);
    }
    return usersActivities;
  }
