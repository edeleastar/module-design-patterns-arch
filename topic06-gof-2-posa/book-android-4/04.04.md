#JSON & HTTP Libraries

The pacemaker-service project is using the following libraries in its REST implementation:

- <https://hc.apache.org>
- <https://sourceforge.net/projects/flexjson/>

To keep our implementation reasonably simple we will incorporate these libraries directly into our Android project.

Library download and integration is just a matter of the correct Gradle entries:

##build.gradle

~~~
android {
    useLibrary 'org.apache.http.legacy'
}

dependencies {
    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.1.1'
    compile group: 'com.google.guava', name: 'guava', version: '18.0'
    compile 'net.sf.flexjson:flexjson:3.2'
}
~~~

The http library is largely superseded now, but we can use the same one we used on the pacemaker-service to keep our projects aligned for the moment.
