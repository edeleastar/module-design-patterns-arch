#Fundamentals

 When Architecting enterprise solutions, we want to model behavior separately from structure.

 As Architects, our goal is to always be in a position to understand a solution design in the CONTEXT it was prepared.

 Your design tells a story, from which context and structure emerges for a reviewer to understand what you mean.

 This is important because context changes over time (i.e. new process, new environment, new roles, new system contraints, new requirements, ..the list goes on).

 A design that was fit for purpose and complete yesterday, may not be any longer considering present context.

 Separating behavior from structure helps to understand the validity of architectural decisions at a point in time.

 As applications get more complex, get combined, and get used in many different was (i.e. many contexts) by many actors (i.e. users or systems), separating behavior from structure helps surfacing gaps in the architecture.
