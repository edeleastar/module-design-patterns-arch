##Solution:

This is a solution:

These three commits encapsulate the application of the pattern:

- <https://github.com/wit-design-patterns-2016/pacemaker-console/commit/aa968dd94fb6332ac9aa71c4055bed5ae082e210>
- <https://github.com/wit-design-patterns-2016/pacemaker-console/commit/0357413d3fd8a203b9d23bc3dad61a4967df54b8>
- <https://github.com/wit-design-patterns-2016/pacemaker-console/commit/da81a3b9ebc741cd99c7b106e86bb05840af2c93>


Verify that this is equivalent to your solution.

##Exercise:

Consider introducing a new serializer to support the YAML file format:

- <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>

This is a prominent java YAML library:

- <http://www.snakeyaml.org>

Here is a version of a `write` method that will serialize our stack data structure:

~~~java
  public void write() throws Exception
  {
    Yaml yaml = new Yaml();
    FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(file);
    for (Object o : stack)
    {
      yaml.dump (stack.pop(), writer);
    }
    writer.close();
  }
~~~

Try this out and explore the generated output.

Is it possible to seamlessly integrate this into pacemaker as another serializer?
