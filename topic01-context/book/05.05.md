#Strategy

See if you can complete the implementation such that the `cff` command works as expected.

This will require:

- a Serializer interface
- this interface is to be implemented by XMLSerializer & JSONSerializer
- refactor Pacemaker API to use this interface instead of the concrete classes

The overall effect should be to keep knowledge of the specific serializer away from the PacemanerAPI class.

The solution is presented in the next step.
