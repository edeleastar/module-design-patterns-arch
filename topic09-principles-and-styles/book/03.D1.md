#STEP D1 – Creating the BEHAVIORAL VIEW

The purpose of this View is to outline:

1. How data gets collected and prepared for purposes building analytics data sets 
2. How analytics data sets are served to users 
 

###D1a: DATA PREPARATION

A Data Preparation process is triggered every time a User uploads new data points (e.g. a new activity feed, a modification of heath profile).
The result of the data preparation stores User Analytics Views into Runkeeper's Data Warehouse.
