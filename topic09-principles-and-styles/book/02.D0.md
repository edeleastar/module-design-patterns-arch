1. Who will interact with the dashboard, performing what kind of actions 
2. What will interact with the dashboard, performing what kind of actions

All User data candidate for Analytics is collected and correlated from 3 distinct sources of information: PostgreSQL (User Activity / Workouts data), REDIS (User Geo-positioning / Health Tracking data points) and HealthGraph (User Health Profile data).

Resulting datasets (prepared for Analytics Dashboard reporting) are then persisted in a single location which is the authoritative source for reporting, i.e. providing data that can be analyzed under a number of reporting dimensions.
