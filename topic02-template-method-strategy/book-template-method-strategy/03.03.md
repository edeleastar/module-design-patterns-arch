#Xtend TemplateMethod

Xtend is one the potential successors to Java (others include Scala and Kotlin). Xtend has some advantages over these, not least its simplicity and robust implementation. We will review xtend on next weeks lab, but you can try the experiments in the next few steps in order to gain an initial familiarity.

You must be using `Eclipse for DSL Developers` distribution, or install XTend into your version of eclipse.

- <https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/>

In the same project, create a new package called `xtemplatemethod`. Using the eclipse context menu, create an `XTend class` called MinmaSolver. Once you have created the class, eclipse will generate an error if the XTend libraries are not included.. Selecting the error in the IDE, and selecting autocorrect may be the easies way of having the libraries included.

We can place multiple classes in a single source file in XTend:

##MinimaSolver

~~~
package xtemplatemethod

abstract class MinimaSolver 
{
  new()
  {
  }

  def double[] minima(double[] line)
  {
    // do some pre-processing
    var double[] result = null
    result = algorithm(line)
    // do some post-processing
    result
  }
 
  def abstract double[] algorithm(double[] line);
}

class BisectionSolver extends MinimaSolver
{
  override algorithm(double[] line) 
  {
    // Compute Minima on line
    //  - algorithm
    val x = 5.5;  // simulated result
    val y = 6.6;  // simulated result
    #[x, y]
  }
}

class NewtonsMethodSolver extends MinimaSolver
{
  override algorithm(double[] line) 
  {
    // Compute Minima on line
    //  - algorithm
    val x = 3.3;  // simulated result
    val y = 4.4;  // simulated result
    #[x, y]    
  }
}

class LeastSquaresSolver extends MinimaSolver
{
  override algorithm(double[] line) 
  {
    // Compute Minima on line
    //  - algorithm
    val x = 1.1;  // simulated result
    val y = 2.2;  // simulated result
    #[x, y]     
  }
~~~

##MinimaSolverTest

~~~java
package xtemplatemethod

import static org.junit.Assert.*
import org.junit.Test

class MinimaSolverTest
{
  val line = #[ 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, -1.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0 ]
  var MinimaSolver solver

  @Test
  def newtonsMetod()
  {
    solver = new NewtonsMethodSolver
    val result = solver.minima(line)
    assertTrue(result.get(0) == 3.3)
    assertTrue(result.get(1) == 4.4)
  }
  
    @Test
  def leastSquares()
  {
    solver = new LeastSquaresSolver
    val result = solver.minima(line)
    assertTrue(result.get(0) == 1.1)
    assertTrue(result.get(1) == 2.2)
  }
  @Test
  def bisection()
  {
    solver = new BisectionSolver
    val result = solver.minima(line)
    assertTrue(result.get(0) == 5.5)
    assertTrue(result.get(1) == 6.6)
  }
}
~~~

You may need to manually add 'XTend Library' to the project for the above to compile. To do this, select the Project in Package Explorer and then select the context menu. From this menu select 'Build Path' and from there locate the 'Add Library' dialog. 'Xtend Library' will be available here if Xtend is installed correctly.

Verify that these tests pass..

If there are no errors, eclipse will have generated a source folder called 'xtend-gen' in the project, with a matching set of packages for the xtend sources.. Explore the generated 'xtemplatemethod' package, you should see the java version of:

- BisectionSolver
- NewtonsMethodSolver
- LeastSquaresSolver
- MinimaSolver
- MinimaSolverTest

Have a close look at each of these classes, and note any differences from the xtend versions..
