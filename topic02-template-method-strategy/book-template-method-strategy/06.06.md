#Single Abstract Method

SAM optimisation and lambda conversion is an interesting topic in Java 8:

Xtend supports this feature - as we can see with a simple experiment. Going back to the xstrategysam package, include this extra test:

~~~java
  @Test
  def SAM()
  { 
    val algorithms = new Algorithms()
    
    solver = new MinimaSolver (algorithms.bisection);
    val result = solver.minima(line)
    assertTrue(result.get(0) == 5.5)
    assertTrue(result.get(1) == 6.6)
  }
~~~

You will need to import the Algorightms class from the xstrategy package:

~~~
import xstrategy.Algorithms
~~~

This looks innocent, but relfect again on what is happening here:

~~~java
    solver = new MinimaSolver (algorithms.bisection);
    val result = solver.minima(line);
~~~

The solver being used here is this one:

~~~java
class MinimaSolver 
{
  new()
  {
  }

  def double[] minima(double[] line, FindMinima findMinima)
  {
    // do some pre-processing
    val result = findMinima..algorithm(line)
    // do some post-processing
    result
  }
}
~~~

... which expects an object implementing FindMinima interface. However, we are passing an lambda like this:


~~~java
  public val bisection     = [ List<Double> line | 
                                // Compute Minima on line
                                //  - algorithm
                                val x = 5.5  // simulated result
                                val y = 6.6  // simulated result
                                #[x, y]    
                             ]  
~~~

which has, in fact, nothing to do with the FindMinima interface:
