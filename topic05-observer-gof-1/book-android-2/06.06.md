#Adapter II

The existing adapter we are using in the ActivitiesList class is a stock adapter from the SDK:

- <http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ArrayAdapter.html>

We can write our own custom adapter to do the same job:

~~~java
class ActivityAdapter extends ArrayAdapter<MyActivity>
{
  private Context        context;
  public  List<MyActivity> activities;

  public ActivityAdapter(Context context, List<MyActivity> activities)
  {
    super(context, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, activities);
    this.context   = context;
    this.activities = activities;
  }

  @Override
  public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent)
  {
    LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater) context.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);

    View     view     = inflater.inflate(android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, parent, false);
    MyActivity activity = activities.get(position);
    TextView textView = (TextView) view.findViewById(android.R.id.text1);

    textView.setText("" + activity);

    return view;
  }

  @Override
  public int getCount()
  {
    return activities.size();
  }
}
~~~

Place this in the same source file as ActivitiesList class.

In the above, we have precise control over how we layout the activity data in each row. We are not using this yet, so our display is still primitive.

Using this adapter in ActivitiesList.onCreate instead of the library one is straightforward :

~~~java
    ActivityAdapter activitiesAdapter = new ActivityAdapter(this,  activities);
    activitiesListView.setAdapter(activitiesAdapter);
    activitiesAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
~~~

This should now work as expected.
