#Memento I

Currently, your createActitivyButtonPressed method in the CreateActivity class looks like this:

~~~java
 public void createActivityButtonPressed (View view)
  {
    double distance = distancePicker.getValue();
    MyActivity activity = new MyActivity (activityType.getText().toString(), activityLocation.getText().toString(), distance);

    activities.add(activity);
    Log.v("Pacemaker", "CreateActivity Button Pressed with " + distance);
  }
~~~

We are creating an activity, and adding it to a list held locally. If the user would like to see the activities, this handler will switch views:

~~~java
  public void listActivityButtonPressed (View view) 
  {
    Log.v("Pacemaker", "List Activityies Button Pressed");
    Intent intent = new Intent(this, ActivitiesList.class);
    startActivity (intent);
  }
~~~

However, the activity is not able to access the list we have been updating with new activities.

This is the current Activity class:

~~~java
package org.pacemaker.pacemaker;

import static com.google.common.base.Objects.toStringHelper;
import com.google.common.base.Objects;

public class MyActivity
{
  public Long   id;
  public String type;
  public String location;
  public double distance;

  public MyActivity()
  {
  }

  public MyActivity(String type, String location, double distance)
  {
    this.type      = type;
    this.location  = location;
    this.distance  = distance;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString()
  {
    return toStringHelper(this).addValue(id)
        .addValue(type)
        .addValue(location)
        .addValue(distance)
        .toString();
  }

  @Override
  public boolean equals(final Object obj)
  {
    if (obj instanceof MyActivity)
    {
      final MyActivity other = (MyActivity) obj;
      return Objects.equal(type, other.type)
          && Objects.equal(location,  other.location)
          && Objects.equal(distance,  other.distance);
    }
    else
    {
      return false;
    }
  }

  @Override
  public int hashCode()
  {
    return Objects.hashCode(this.id, this.type, this.location, this.distance);
  }
}
~~~

Augment this class with the following features (as members of the class):

~~~java
  public MyActivity(Parcel in)
  {
    this.type = in.readString();
    this.location = in.readString();
    this.distance = in.readDouble();
  }

  @Override
  public int describeContents()
  {
    return 0;
  }

  @Override
  public void writeToParcel(Parcel dest, int flags)
  {
    dest.writeString(type);
    dest.writeString(location);
    dest.writeDouble(distance);
  }

  public static final Parcelable.Creator<MyActivity> CREATOR = new Parcelable.Creator<MyActivity>()
  {
    public MyActivity createFromParcel(Parcel in)
    {
      return new MyActivity(in);
    }

    public MyActivity[] newArray(int size)
    {
      return new MyActivity[size];
    }
  };
~~~

You will need to make the Activity class implement the Parcelable interface:

~~~
...
public class MyActivity implements Parcelable
{
...
~~~


This will enable instances of the class to be 'parcelabe' - i.e. externalized to an external to another object.

We can transfer such a 'parcel' to another activity by adding it to a 'bundle' for that activity, and adding it as an 'extra' for the activity to pick up:


~~~java
  public void listActivityButtonPressed (View view) 
  {
    Log.v("Pacemaker", "List Activityies Button Pressed");
    Intent intent = new Intent(this, ActivitiesList.class);
    Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
    bundle.putParcelableArrayList("activities", activities);
    intent.putExtras(bundle);
    startActivity (intent);
  }
~~~

This will cause difficulty initiall, with an error on this line:

~~~
    bundle.putParcelableArrayList("activities", activities);
~~~

This is because of the way we have declared the activities list:

~~~
  private List<MyActivity> activities = new ArrayList<MyActivity>();
~~~

It need to be explicity and ArrayList for the Parcelable builder to compile:

~~~
  private ArrayList<MyActivity> activities = new ArrayList<MyActivity>();
~~~
